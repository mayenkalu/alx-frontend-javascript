# ES6 Promises

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and implementing Promises in JavaScript. Promises are a powerful feature that allow for asynchronous programming, enabling better control flow and error handling. In this project, we delve into understanding the "how," "why," and "what" of Promises.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Promises: We explain the purpose and benefits of using Promises in JavaScript applications.
* `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods: We provide a detailed guide on how to use these methods effectively, showcasing their role in handling Promise states and asynchronous operations.
* `every` method of the Promise object: We demonstrate the usage of the `every` method, which allows for executing multiple Promises concurrently and returning results when all Promises are fulfilled.
* Error handling with `throw` and `try`: We discuss error handling techniques in Promises, including throwing and catching errors within Promise chains.
* The `await` operator: We explore how to use the `await` operator with Promises, allowing for more readable and synchronous-like code when dealing with asynchronous operations.
Utilizing async functions: We provide practical examples and guidelines on how to create and use async functions, simplifying the management of Promises and improving code readability.
